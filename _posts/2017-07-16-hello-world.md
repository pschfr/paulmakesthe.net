One of the first things a programmer does when learning a new language is figure out how to print text on the screen. Most of the time, it's the famous "Hello, World!" text.

&nbsp;

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
	printf("Hello, World!\n");
}
```

So this is my hello to you. I hope you'll stick around.
