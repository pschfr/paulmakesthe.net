One of the first things a programmer does when learning a new language is figure out how to print text on the screen. Most of the time, it's the famous "Hello, World!" text.

&nbsp;

```c
#include <stdio.h>

main() {
	printf("Hello, World!\n");
}
```
<small>*This is the programming language C, from a 1974 Bell Laboratories book. See the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) about Hello World.*</small>

So this is my hello to you. I hope you'll stick around.
