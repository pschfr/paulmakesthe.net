<p>As we float through everyday life, we slowly discover what has meaning. What may be meaningful for you, is not for others. Learn to love this difference, and then progress is inevitable.</p>
<p>Everything in the world is somehow designed, and everything that&#8217;s designed can be improved. That&#8217;s an extremely powerful thought that I can&#8217;t manage to forget. Because of this, I have a high standard for my work. Design is all about choices; whether they are good or bad, is up to the designer.</p>
<p>I attended the Art Institute of Pittsburgh for Web Design, and the Erie County Technical School for Computer Programming while in high school. That experience has showed me a new view on this world, and gave me the ambition to try to fix it and make it more beautiful. I&#8217;m also obsessed with space and electronic dance music.</p>
